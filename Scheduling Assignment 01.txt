Scheduling Simulation                         


You are to write an application that will allow us to simulate various 
scheduling algorithms. In order to test our simulation the data file 
"Simulation1-Data.txt" has been prepared.  The file contains a number of 
lines of data.  Each line contains information about a process and has 
the following format:

processID processArriavalTime processServiceTime

For this assignment we will assume that our system contains one processor,
and the ready processes are scheduled using a first in first our (FIFO)
strategy.

The simulator should maintain:
1. a list of the processes that are in the ready state.
2. a list of the processes that have completed.
3. a list of the process(es) that are currently running.
4. a clock to keep track of the current time.

Your simulator should use separate threads to manage the clock, entry of
jobs into the system, and the scheduling of processes.

Your simulation should allow us to determine:
1. the time when each process will finish
2. the amount of time that each process spends on the ready list
3. the total time and average time that all processes spend on the ready list.
4. the time when all processes will finish.


Assignment is due on 10-22-2014
